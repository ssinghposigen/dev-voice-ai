      "00:03,00:04,Denise,Customer,This is her.\n",
      "00:05,00:17,Faren,Employee,Hi Miss Denise. This is Faren calling from Paradise Sun Solar on a recorded line. Um, I was reaching out to you in regards to the SMS that you uh sent over to our team requesting for the permits for your home.\n",
      "00:19,00:50,Denise,Customer,Yeah, because um, okay. There's big problems with my roof. And ever since solar put it up and made all the holes, which started the problems. And then the tree came down, which finished the problems. I'm finding out now that my roof shouldn't have never even been eligible for solar. One, because the roof was it old. And I never even knew I have a rubber roof on the flat part. I didn't know all this stuff. I had no idea.\n",
      "00:51,01:09,Denise,Customer,So now my insurance company sent me a check to get a new roof put on. I'm waiting for it. And solar said that they were going to remove them of no cost to me and so I could get the roof done and then put it back on.\n",
      "01:10,01:21,Denise,Customer,But I'm like saying I should have never had solar in the beginning and some my contractor wanted to know if solar had permits to do this because this shouldn't have been done.\n",
      "01:23,01:31,Faren,Employee,Okay. Yes ma'am, we did have the permits to do so. Um, your best email address is Denise Parachini at SBCglobal.net. Is that correct?\n",
      "01:32,01:33,Denise,Customer,Yes.\n",
      "01:33,01:45,Faren,Employee,Okay. If you check your email now, you should have received two separate emails. And I uh sent you over all of the documentation that we did get permitting from the city of West Haven to do this.\n",
      "01:46,01:55,Denise,Customer,Now, I was told if your roof is old, solar's not supposed to put them on. How come you guys did it when I had problems with my roof and didn't even know?\n",
      "01:56,02:16,Faren,Employee,Whenever we do an install on a roof, we check the integrity of the area where we intend to install. And as long as that particular area is viable for the install, then we go ahead with the install. Uh, but of course, we are not licensed certified roofers. We're solar installers. So the things that we look for are going to be different.\n",
      "02:18,02:30,Denise,Customer,Well, I have very, very big problems here. So, now my insurance company dropped me and I'm having a hard time getting insurance now. So I have lots of problems because of the roof.\n",
      "02:30,02:41,Denise,Customer,And the other thing is, um, soon as I get the check, I think I'm going to proceed to have the roof done. So how much notice do you need to remove the panels?\n",
      "02:42,02:52,Faren,Employee,Um, we like to have 30 days notice, but if you call me at directly at this line that I'm calling you from, I can reach out to that team and try to get you as soon of a service date as possible.\n",
      "02:53,03:00,Denise,Customer,Well, one, it's going to depend on the weather, naturally. And two, when I get that check.\n",
      "03:01,03:04,Faren,Employee,Okay. So who who do I call when I'm ready to move forward?\n",
      "03:05,03:13,Faren,Employee,You can call me. Did it show up as my number being uh 985-277-4363 number?\n",
      "03:14,03:17,Denise,Customer,Okay. Well, what's your first name again?\n",
      "03:17,03:26,Faren,Employee,My first name is Faren. You can either call me at that number directly or you can send me an email directly to that email uh response that I went ahead and sent over to you with the permits.\n",
      "03:27,03:29,Denise,Customer,Okay. And what's the phone number one more time?\n",
      "03:30,03:36,Faren,Employee,It's area code 985-277-4363. And if you can give me as early of notice as possible so I can reach out to them and try to expedite it, you know, that'll make it easier. But of course, like one day ahead of time isn't going to be, you know, realistic.\n",
      "03:47,03:57,Denise,Customer,Oh okay. I get it. Well, I should be getting the check sometime this week. Then I got to get the roofer and then we got to make sure the weather is good enough to do it. So, of all times.\n",
      "04:00,04:07,Denise,Customer,Okay. I will get back to you as soon as I know. I just wanted that information because I was asked all these questions.\n",
      "04:08,04:15,Faren,Employee,Okay. Okay. Thank you for calling. You're welcome. Just reach out to me if you have any other, you know, questions.\n",
      "04:16,04:17,Denise,Customer,Okay, thank you.\n",
      "04:18,04:20,Faren,Employee,Okay. You're welcome Miss Denise. Have a good day, okay?\n",
